# What is CommuniCats?
CommuniCats is an easy to use IPC (Inter Process Communication) framework. 

# What is IPC?
IPC is a method to communicate variables between different processes. For example, A has a variable x. B needs to know x, but x changes over time in A.
An import statement would only run A, but we want to run the two files in parallel. With an IPC, we would make A send x to B when B needs x.

# Why you should use CommuniCats
CommuniCats is useful for communicating data between different files. Yes, you could just put all the data in one file, but then where is the orginazation in that?
