# CommuniCats
CommuniCats is an easy to use IPC (Inter Process Communication) framework. 

# What is IPC?
IPC is a way to communicate variables between different processes. For example, A has a variable x. B needs to know x, but x changes over time in A.
An import statement would only run A, but we want to run the two files in parallel. With an IPC, we would make A would send x to B when B needs x.
